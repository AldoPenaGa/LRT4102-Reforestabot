### Introduction

In this report, we explore two essential structures: using URDF to construct a graphically depicted Cartesian robot with configurable dimensions and assessing ROS functionality with Plot Juggler. When developing the URDF model, we create a graphical representation of a Cartesian robot and use web-based tools to see and test it. Plot Juggler is then used to visually portray and analyze the most recent ROS practice (atg and dtg controller: https://github.com/AldoPenaGa/LRT4102-Lab3-ROSEuclidean), with the goal of depicting the error correction while charting the progression of key metrics like ATG and DTG. The ROS program is used then alongside ROSBag to verify its reliability to reproduce the actions related to the topics listened to, this was examined with Plot Juggler. This research emphasizes the efficient use of URDF for robotic design and Plot Juggler for accurate ROS analysis, resulting in improved comprehension of the design of robotic systems.

**URDF** 

URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is an XML file format used in robotics to distinguish between robots and robotic systems, acting as a standard in simulation and robotic environments. It thoroughly explains the robot's geometry, joints, linkages, sensors, and other critical structural and kinematic features. A URDF file contains elements such as links that represent robot parts, joints that define kinematic relationships between links, collision models for collision calculations, visual models for graphical representation, inertias for mass and inertia properties, and sensors mounted on the robot such as cameras and lidars.


**PlotJuggler**

PlotJuggler is a data visualization tool created within ROS for use in robotics and other telemetry-related applications, featuring real-time data processing capabilities. PlotJuggler's key features and tools include an intuitive user interface for efficient data loading, visualization, and manipulation; support for various data types, including numerical values, vectors, matrices, images, and ROS messages; real-time visualization for monitoring and debugging running robotic systems; customization options for graph appearance and behavior, such as axis configuration, colors, and labels; and seamless integration with ROS for direct visualization


**ROSbag**

ROSBag is a flexible tool in the Robot Operating System (ROS) ecosystem that can capture, store, and play back ROS message data. It is a precious tool for data collection and analysis in robotics and related subjects. ROSBag enables users to record and preserve data streams from many ROS topics including as sensor readings, control instructions, and system states, allowing for offline analysis, troubleshooting, and experimentation. Its versatility and interoperability with ROS make it a vital component for robotics development and study based on data.

### Problems
There were multiple tasks to be addressed, for the URDF:

1- Create a Cartesian robot with free dimensions, the robot will be purely visual, use the website to verify its design.

Meanwhile for the PlotJuggler:

1- Plot and analyze the operation of the last laboratory.

2- Demonstrate that the final error is 0 or very close to 0. 

3- Plot the evolution of ATG and DTG. 

4- Run your program in a loop, at least 4 times, create a ROSBAG and then plot the entire experiment in Plot Juggler.


### Codes

The codes and files related to this practice can be found in two separate folders regarding its domain.

**URDF_Cartesian**

This XML file defines the framework of the Cartesian robot for simulation, including physical linkages, linear motion joints, movement restrictions, and visual features. It includes the materials for the parts' appearance, links indicating physical components such as the base and movement axes, joints that allow movement between links, and visual geometry for each component.

**dtg_atg_withcontrollerPublishing**

This Python code works similarly to the one developed in the last practice https://github.com/AldoPenaGa/LRT4102-Lab3-ROSEuclidean/blob/main/lab03/src/dtg_atg_withcontroller.py . The key difference is that it publishes the linear and angular errors and the distance and angle to go in the topics `/error_linear`, `/error_angular`, `/distance_to_go` and `/angle_to_go` using Float32 data type:

```Python
    error_linear_publisher = rospy.Publisher('/error_linear', Float32, queue_size=10)
    error_angular_publisher = rospy.Publisher('/error_angular', Float32, queue_size=10)

    distance_to_go_publisher = rospy.Publisher('/distance_to_go', Float32, queue_size=10)
    angle_to_go_publisher = rospy.Publisher('/angle_to_go', Float32, queue_size=10)
```
This will help in the plotting for PlotJuggler analysis.

**Other helpful codes and commands**

Here are presented the commands and codes that can be considered helpful to the depletion of the code:

- Run ROS: roscore
For the correct execution verify that ~/.bashrc has IP addresses that correspond to the master URI and local to be the same as the computer.

- Run the turtlesim node: `rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node`
- Reset the environment: `rosservice call reset`
- 

### Results

The first image (figure 1) `URDF.png` shows the built URDF model displayed in the following page https://mymodelrobot.appspot.com/5629499534213120 , the joints `joint_x`, `joint_y`, `joint_z` permits the moving of the model.

Meanwhile, the next series of pictures (figures illustrate the results for the PlotJuggler and ROSbag section. The figure 2 `PlotATGDTG` shows the correct plotting of the topics `/error_linear`, `/error_angular`, `/distance_to_go` and `/angle_to_go`.

![Figure 2. Test of the publishers and the recent created topics in PlotJuggler](https://github.com/AldoPenaGa/LRT4102-Lab4-URDFandPlotJuggler/blob/main/Pictures/PlotATGDTG.png)

`TestPub1`, `TestPub2` and `TestPub3` illustrate how the publisher is working on the intended topics.

Finally, `ROSbagRecord` and `RosbagReplay` show the results whilst using ROSbag as a tool for replicating the information published among the topics. The following commands were run in order to successfully use ROSbag: 

- For recording: rosbag record -O NameOfTheRecording.bag  /error_linear /error_angular /angle_to_go /distance_to_go
- For replaying: rosbag play NameOfTheRecording.bag

**It is important to run these commands in the directory expected to allocate the recordings.**

### Conclusion
This report meets the objective of developing a graphically represented Cartesian robot using URDF and examining ROS functionality with Plot Juggler. The goals were reached while creating a URDF model to create a graphical representation of the robot and using Plot Juggler to analyze ROS performance by demonstrating relevant parameters evolution. We showed the utility of using ROSbag in a robotic system. One last comment to make which we were previously aware of but would be ideal to highlight is the tendency that ROSbag has to make slight changes every time a ROSbag replay is run, we highly recommend not using ROSbag as a reliable tool for replication but a tool for analysis.
